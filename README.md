# Mechanic App Tasks Repository

Welcome to the **Mechanic App Tasks Repository**, a curated collection of tasks designed to work seamlessly with the [Mechanic app](https://mechanic.dev/) for Shopify. This repository aims to centralize and share tasks that automate and extend Shopify's functionality.

- Build bespoke functionality tailored to individual store requirements.

Mechanic empowers users to go beyond Shopify's built-in features, offering the flexibility to design solutions specific to your store's needs.
